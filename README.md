# Algorithms
JavaScript solutions I've written for algorithm problems, probably only for my own reference


## Current list:
- [String Permutations](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/stringPermutations.js): Given a string, list all unique permutations of it in an array.  
Time-complexity: O(n!)
- [Balanced Brackets](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/balancedBrackets.js): Given a string of opening and closing brackets, determine whether it is balanced.  
Time-complexity: O(n)
- [Largest Subsequence Sum](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/largestSubarraySum.js): Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence of the array.  
I wrote a brute force algo and then looked online to write an optimal dynamic programming algo.  
Time-complexity: O(n), Space-complexity: O(1)
- [Longest Subarray Length](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/lengthOfLongestSubstring.js): From Leetcode #3: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
Time-complexity: O(n), Space-complexity: O(n)

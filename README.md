# Algorithms
JavaScript solutions I've written for algorithm problems, probably only for my own reference


## Current list:
- [String Permutations](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/stringPermutations.js): Given a string, list all unique permutations of it in an array.  
Time-complexity: O(n!)
- [Balanced Brackets](https://github.com/smilevideo/algorithms/blob/master/balancedBrackets.js): Given a string of opening and closing brackets, determine whether it is balanced.  
Time-complexity: O(n)
